        <rdfs:isDefinedBy>It refers to the process of providing or retaining the necessary surrounding information, background, or frame of reference required to correctly understand and interpret a model, data element, or relationship as it transitions between different &quot;grounds&quot; or is shared across diverse enterprises.

It is crucial for semantic preservation, ensuring that the original meaning, purpose, and constraints of an artifact are not lost or misinterpreted when it is viewed or processed in a new environment that might have a different formalism, conventions, or implicit assumptions.

This is achieved through mechanisms like hyper-edges (which explicitly link concepts across different contexts) and annotations (which attach additional semantic information to model elements that might otherwise be lost in direct transformations).

Effective contextualization allows for the unambiguous interpretation of information, bridging the semantic gaps that arise from heterogeneous systems, different domains (as represented by Hypermodel Branches), and the varied purposes for which models are created. It is fundamental for achieving continuous operational interoperability by ensuring that all participating systems and users consistently grasp the intended meaning of exchanged information.</rdfs:isDefinedBy>

        <rdfs:isDefinedBy>It is a generalization of a graph, where edge can connect any number of vertices. Formally, a hypergraph H is a pair H=(X, E) where X is a set of elements, called nodes or vertices, and E is a set of non-empty subsets of X called hyper-edges or links... While graph edges are paris of nodes, hyper-edges are arbitrary sets of nodes and can therefore contain an arbitrary number of nodes. However, it is oftne useful to study hypergraphs where all hyper-edges have the same cardinality: a k-uniform hypergraph is an hypergraph such that al its hyper-edges have size k (in other words, it is a collection of sets of size k). So a 2-unifrom hyper-graph is a graph, a 3-uniform hypergraph is a collection of triples, and so on...
Unlike graphs, hypergraphs are difficult to draw on paper, so they tend to be studied using the nomenclatre of the set theory rather than the more pictorial descriptions( like trees, forests and cycles) of graph theory.</rdfs:isDefinedBy>

        <rdfs:isDefinedBy>A dynamic and ongoing state where interoperability is not a one-off achievement but a sustained capability for maintaining seamless interaction and information flow despite evolving technical landscapes, changing business practices, and shifts in contextual requirements. It implies the ability to adapt to changes in systems, standards, and organizational structures over time, particularly vital for the long lifecycle of products in PLM and the continuous evolution of their multiple representations across multiple enterprises. This requires proactive management, consistent application of standards, and robust toolchains.</rdfs:isDefinedBy>

        <rdfs:isDefinedBy>Includes tools and systems used to facilitate real-time or near real-time interaction, data sharing, and synchronized work across different organizations or departments based on the interoperable models and data (e.g., collaborative design platforms, shared data repositories, communication tools, workflow engines). This toolchain leverages the interoperability enabled by the extended hypermodel to ensure consistent understanding across its diverse representations within an extended enterprise or a network of enterprises.</rdfs:isDefinedBy>
